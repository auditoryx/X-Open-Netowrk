/**
 * Chat System Testing Guide
 * 
 * This file contains instructions for testing the booking chat system.
 * 
 * ## Test Setup:
 * 
 * 1. **Create a test booking**:
 *    - Navigate to the booking creation flow
 *    - Complete a booking between two users (client and provider)
 *    - Note the bookingId from the URL or Firestore
 * 
 * 2. **Access the chat**:
 *    - Navigate to `/booking/{bookingId}/chat`
 *    - OR click the "Open Chat" button from `/booking/{bookingId}`
 * 
 * ## Test Cases:
 * 
 * ### 🔐 Security Tests:
 * - ✅ Only client and provider can access the chat
 * - ✅ Unauthorized users get error message
 * - ✅ Messages are only visible to authorized users
 * 
 * ### 💬 Functionality Tests:
 * - ✅ Messages send in real-time
 * - ✅ Messages appear instantly for both parties
 * - ✅ Messages are ordered by timestamp
 * - ✅ Proper sender identification (client vs provider)
 * - ✅ Message styling (left vs right alignment)
 * - ✅ Typing indicator appears
 * - ✅ Auto-scroll to bottom
 * - ✅ Timestamps display correctly
 * 
 * ### 🎨 UI/UX Tests:
 * - ✅ Clean, professional chat interface
 * - ✅ Mobile-responsive design
 * - ✅ Loading states work properly
 * - ✅ Error states display clearly
 * - ✅ Smooth scrolling and animations
 * 
 * ## Test Data Structure:
 * 
 * ### Required booking fields:
 * ```javascript
 * {
 *   clientUid: "user1_uid",
 *   providerUid: "user2_uid", 
 *   clientName: "Client Name",
 *   providerName: "Provider Name",
 *   serviceName: "Service Title",
 *   status: "confirmed"
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Chat message structure:
 * ```javascript
 * {
 *   senderUid: "user_uid",
 *   senderName: "User Name",
 *   text: "Message content",
 *   sentAt: timestamp,
 *   seen: false,
 *   clientUid: "client_uid",
 *   providerUid: "provider_uid"
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Firestore Collections:
 * - `/bookings/{bookingId}` - Booking data
 * - `/chats/{bookingId}/messages/{messageId}` - Chat messages
 * 
 * ## Security Rules Validation:
 * The Firestore rules ensure:
 * 1. Only authenticated users can access chats
 * 2. Users can only read/write if they are the sender, client, or provider
 * 3. Message data includes proper authorization fields
 * 
 * ## Browser Console Testing:
 * Open browser dev tools and check:
 * - No Firebase security rule errors
 * - Real-time updates working
 * - Proper error handling
 * 
 * ## Manual Test Flow:
 * 1. Login as client user
 * 2. Navigate to booking chat page
 * 3. Send a message
 * 4. Login as provider user (different browser/incognito)
 * 5. Navigate to same booking chat page
 * 6. Verify message appears
 * 7. Send reply message
 * 8. Switch back to client browser
 * 9. Verify reply appears in real-time
 * 10. Test unauthorized access with different user
