The complete beta issue seeding system is fully prepared and ready for execution. All files are in place and validated.

## 🎯 What Will Be Created

- **181 Total Issues** - All specified in the Beta Issue Generation Guide
- **18 Critical Issues** - Automatically assigned to @auditoryx
- **4 Milestones** - Beta Launch, Beta v1.1, Beta v1.2, Post-Beta

Backlog (181) → Ready (0) → In Progress (0) → Review (0) → Testing (0) → Done (0)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Authentication Fails
```bash
gh auth status
gh auth login --web
```

### If Project Creation Fails
- Project boards may require specific repository permissions
- Check if you have "Maintain" or "Admin" access
- Manually create project if needed, issues will still be created

### If Some Issues Fail to Create
- The script continues even if individual issues fail
- Check the final summary for any failures
- Re-run specific issue creation if needed

## ✨ What Happens After Creation

1. **All critical issues assigned to @auditoryx** - Ready for immediate attention
2. **All issues in Backlog** - Ready for sprint planning and team assignment
3. **Organized by priority** - Easy filtering and planning
4. **Complete milestone structure** - Clear release planning
5. **Detailed issue descriptions** - Tasks and acceptance criteria included

## 🎉 Ready for Beta Sprint Planning

Once executed, your team can:
- Move critical issues to "Ready" and start development
- Assign non-critical issues to team members
- Use project board for sprint planning and progress tracking
- Filter by labels for specialized work (authentication, payments, UI/UX, etc.)
