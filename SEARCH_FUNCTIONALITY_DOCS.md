## Usage Examples

### Example Search Queries
- `"trap"` - Find creators specializing in trap music
- `"Tokyo"` - Find creators based in Tokyo
- `"mixing mastering"` - Find creators offering mixing/mastering services
- `"hip-hop producer"` - Find hip-hop producers
- `"Sarah"` - Find creators named Sarah

### Search Tips (shown in dropdown)
- Search by creator name, tags, or bio
- Try service types like "mixing", "mastering"
- Use genre names like "hip-hop", "electronic"
- Search locations like "Tokyo", "New York"

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `components/explore/SearchBar.tsx` - Main search input component
- Updated `src/app/explore/page.tsx` - Integration with explore page

### Utilities
- `lib/utils/filterByKeyword.ts` - Keyword filtering and scoring logic
- `lib/firestore/searchCreators.ts` - Firestore integration and data fetching

### Key Features
- **Debounced input** (300ms) to prevent excessive API calls
- **Client-side filtering** for responsive search experience
- **Firestore integration** for fetching creator and service data
- **TypeScript support** with proper interfaces
- **Error handling** with fallback states
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS

## Performance Considerations

- Search is debounced to reduce API calls
- Results are limited to 50 creators maximum
- Client-side filtering after Firestore fetch for better performance
- Skeleton loading states for smooth UX
- Recent searches stored locally to reduce repeated queries

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Highlighting**: Add highlighted text for matched terms in results
2. **Auto-suggestions**: Real-time suggestions as user types
3. **Advanced filters**: Combine search with existing filter panel
4. **Search analytics**: Track popular search terms
5. **Fuzzy matching**: Handle typos and similar terms
6. **Voice search**: Speech-to-text input capability

### Firestore Optimization
Consider adding a `keywords` array field to creator documents containing:
- Lowercase versions of name, bio, location, genres, tags
- This would enable more efficient Firestore queries using `array-contains`

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Empty search** - Should show all creators
2. **Single keyword** - Should return relevant creators
3. **Multiple keywords** - Should combine scoring
4. **Location search** - Should find creators by location
5. **Service search** - Should find creators by service offerings
6. **Genre search** - Should find creators by music genre
7. **Recent searches** - Should save and recall previous searches
8. **Clear search** - Should reset to default explore view
