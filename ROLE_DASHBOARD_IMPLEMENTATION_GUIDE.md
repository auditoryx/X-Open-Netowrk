## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. User authentication working
2. Firestore collections: `bookings`, `messages`, `services`
3. Development server running on port 3004

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Role Dashboard Access
- **Test**: Navigate to role-specific dashboards
- **URLs**: 
  - `http://localhost:3004/dashboard/artist`
  - `http://localhost:3004/dashboard/producer`
  - `http://localhost:3004/dashboard/studio`

- **Expected**: Correct theming, navigation, and role-specific content

#### 2. Booking Management
- **Test**: Booking preview functionality
- **Steps**:
  1. Create test bookings in different statuses
  2. View dashboard booking preview
  3. Click "View All" to navigate to full bookings page
- **Expected**: Accurate counts, status indicators, navigation works

#### 3. Message Threading
- **Test**: Message preview with unread counts
- **Steps**:
  1. Create message threads with user as participant
  2. Set unread counts in messageThreads collection
  3. View dashboard message preview
- **Expected**: Unread badges, participant display, timestamp formatting

#### 4. Service Management

### Database Structure Requirements

#### MessageThreads Collection
```firestore
/messageThreads/{threadId}
├── participants: [uid1, uid2]
├── lastMessage: {
│   ├── content: string
│   ├── senderId: string
│   └── timestamp: Timestamp
├── unreadCounts: {
│   ├── uid1: number
│   └── uid2: number
└── bookingId?: string
```

#### Services Collection
```firestore
/services/{serviceId}
├── title: string
├── description: string
├── price: number
├── status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'draft'
├── creatorId: string
├── category: string
├── createdAt: Timestamp
└── updatedAt: Timestamp
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication
- All dashboard routes require authentication
- Role validation prevents unauthorized access
- User data isolation per UID

### Data Access
- Users can only see their own bookings, messages, services
- Firestore security rules should enforce data privacy
- Error handling prevents data leakage
