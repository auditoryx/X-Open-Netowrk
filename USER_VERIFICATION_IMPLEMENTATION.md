# User Verification Application System

This implementation adds a comprehensive verification application system that allows users to apply for verification badges from their profile or dashboard.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. Apply Verification Button Component
- **Smart Status Detection**: Automatically detects current verification status
- **Conditional Display**: Shows appropriate text and state based on user's verification status
- **Two Variants**: Button and card variants for different UI contexts
- **Disabled States**: Prevents re-submission when already verified or pending

### 2. Verification Form Modal
- **Comprehensive Form**: Collects statement and supporting links
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for required fields and URL format
- **Dynamic Link Fields**: Add/remove link fields (up to 5 links)
- **Progress States**: Loading, error, and success states
- **Link Preview**: External link icons for submitted URLs

### 3. Firestore Integration
- **Structured Data**: Stores verification requests in `/verifications/{userId}`
- **Status Management**: Tracks pending, approved, and rejected states
- **Eligibility Checking**: Prevents duplicate applications
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation and error handling

## üìÅ Files Created

### Components
- `src/components/profile/ApplyVerificationButton.tsx` - Main verification button component
- `src/components/profile/VerificationFormModal.tsx` - Application form modal
- `src/app/test-verification/page.tsx` - Testing interface

### Firestore Helpers
- `src/lib/firestore/submitVerificationRequest.ts` - Complete verification system logic

### Modified Files
- `src/app/profile/edit/page.tsx` - Added verification card to profile edit
- `src/app/profile/[uid]/page.tsx` - Added verification button to user's own profile

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure

### Verification Requests Collection
```typescript
/verifications/{userId}
{
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  statement: string;
  links: string[];
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt?: Timestamp;
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewNotes?: string;
}
```

### Example Data
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "Audio Engineer",
  "statement": "I have 10+ years of experience in audio production...",
  "links": [
    "https://portfolio.johndoe.com",
    "https://instagram.com/johndoe_audio",
    "https://soundcloud.com/johndoe"
  ],
  "status": "pending",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-02T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Apply Verification Button

**Button Variant:**
```tsx
import ApplyVerificationButton from '@/components/profile/ApplyVerificationButton';

<ApplyVerificationButton
  userId={user.uid}
  userData={{
    name: user.name,
    role: user.role,
    isVerified: user.isVerified
  }}
  variant="button"
/>
```

**Card Variant:**
```tsx
<ApplyVerificationButton
  userId={user.uid}
  userData={{
    name: user.name,
    role: user.role,
    isVerified: user.isVerified
  }}
  variant="card"
  className="w-full"
/>
```

### 2. Verification Form Modal

The modal is automatically included with the button component and handles:
- Form validation
- Submission logic
- Success/error states
- User feedback

### 3. Status Checking

```tsx
import { getVerificationStatus, canApplyForVerification } from '@/lib/firestore/submitVerificationRequest';

// Check if user has applied
const status = await getVerificationStatus(userId);

// Check if user can apply
const eligibility = await canApplyForVerification(userId);
```

## üîí Firestore Security Rules

Add these rules to ensure proper security:

```javascript
// Verification requests
match /verifications/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  
  // Prevent status manipulation by users
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == userId &&
    !("status" in request.resource.data) ||
    resource.data.status == request.resource.data.status;
}
```
