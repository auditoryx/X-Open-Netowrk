FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Stripe (CRITICAL)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

- **Page Compilation**: 3-7s (✅ Acceptable)
- **Server Startup**: 6.5s (✅ Good)
- **Bundle Size**: Large (3,761 modules)

### Recommendations:
1. **Code Splitting**

   // Use dynamic imports for heavy components
   const AdminDashboard = dynamic(() => import('@/components/admin/AdminDashboard'))
   const ContractViewer = dynamic(() => import('@/components/contract/ContractViewer'))
   ```

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Use Next.js Image component
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Add placeholder blurs

3. **Bundle Analysis**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run analyze  # if configured
   ```

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement Redis for sessions
   - Cache Firestore queries
   - Use CDN for static assets
