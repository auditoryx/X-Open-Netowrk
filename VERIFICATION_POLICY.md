# How to Get Verified on AuditoryX

Verification helps protect our community by confirming that a user is who they claim to be. Follow the steps below to request verification.

1. **Complete your profile** – make sure your name, bio and a profile photo are set.
2. **Submit your ID** – use the in‑app form to upload a government issued ID. Only JPG, PNG or PDF files are accepted.
3. **Wait for review** – our team checks submissions in the order they are received. You will see the status of your request on your profile page.
4. **Keep your details accurate** – if your information changes, update your profile and re‑submit documentation.

Accounts in good standing with accurate information will receive a blue check mark once approved. Verified status can be revoked if we discover false or misleading information.
