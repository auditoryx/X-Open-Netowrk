- âœ… Professional HTML email template created
- âœ… Stripe webhook handler enhanced to send confirmation emails
- âœ… Firebase Function `handleStripeWebhook` deployed successfully
- âœ… Dependencies added and lockfiles updated

## Remaining Setup Tasks

### 1. Configure Environment Variables ðŸ”§

You need to set up the following environment variables in Firebase Functions:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /workspaces/X-Open-Netowrk

# Set SendGrid API Key (REQUIRED)
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.api_key="YOUR_ACTUAL_SENDGRID_API_KEY"

# Set SendGrid From Email (REQUIRED)
firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.from_email="booking@auditoryx.com"

# Set Stripe Webhook Secret (REQUIRED for security)
firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_YOUR_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"

# Optional: Set Stripe Secret Key if not already set
firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret="sk_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
```

**After setting environment variables, you MUST redeploy the function:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:handleStripeWebhook
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Webhook ðŸ”—

1. **Go to your Stripe Dashboard** â†’ Webhooks
2. **Add new webhook endpoint** with this URL:
   ```
   https://us-central1-auditory-x-open-network.cloudfunctions.net/handleStripeWebhook-handleStripeWebhook
   ```

3. **Select events to listen for:**
   - `checkout.session.completed`

4. **Copy the webhook signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`) and use it in the environment variable above

### 3. Get Your SendGrid API Key ðŸ“§

1. **Log into your SendGrid account**
2. **Go to Settings â†’ API Keys**
3. **Create a new API key** with "Full Access" permissions
4. **Copy the API key** (starts with `SG.`) and use it in the environment variable above

### 4. Test the Complete Flow ðŸ§ª

Once environment variables are set and the function is redeployed:

1. **Make a test booking** through your application
2. **Complete the Stripe payment**
3. **Check that:**
   - Payment is successful in Stripe
   - Booking status is updated to "paid" in Firestore
   - Confirmation email is sent to the client
   - No errors in Firebase Function logs

### 5. Monitor and Debug ðŸ“Š

**Check Firebase Function logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only handleStripeWebhook
```

**Check SendGrid activity:**
- Go to SendGrid Dashboard â†’ Activity Feed
- Look for email delivery status

**Check Stripe webhook logs:**
- Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
- Check your webhook endpoint for delivery attempts and responses

## Your Webhook Endpoint URL

```
https://us-central1-auditory-x-open-network.cloudfunctions.net/handleStripeWebhook-handleStripeWebhook
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Function configuration is empty"
- Run: `firebase functions:config:get` to verify variables are set
- Redeploy after setting environment variables

### "Webhook signature verification failed"
- Ensure `stripe.webhook_secret` matches your Stripe webhook secret
- Check that the webhook secret starts with `whsec_`

### "SendGrid authentication failed"
- Verify `sendgrid.api_key` is correct and starts with `SG.`
- Ensure API key has full access permissions

### "Email not sending"
- Check SendGrid dashboard for email activity
- Verify `sendgrid.from_email` is a verified sender in SendGrid
- Check Firebase Function logs for detailed error messages
