# Firestore Schema Audit & Field Migration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Firestore Schema Audit & Field-Name Migration system as requested in issue #210.

## ✅ Requirements Completed

### 1. Field Name Scanning
- **Tool**: `scripts/audit-field-names.sh`
- **Functionality**: Scans `src/lib/firestore` and all TypeScript files for legacy field names
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Audit passes with 0 legacy field occurrences

### 2. Migration Script
- **File**: `scripts/migrateFields.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Iterates through affected collections (reviews)
  - Creates timestamped backups in `/backups/<date>.json`
  - Migrates `reviewerId` → `reviewerUid` 
  - Deletes old field names after migration
  - Logs summary and exits with appropriate codes (0 for success, 1 for errors)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Script is runnable with `npm run migrate:fields`

### 3. Unit Tests
- **File**: `src/lib/firestore/__tests__/migrateFields.test.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Tests migration script configuration
  - Validates API route field name updates
  - Runs field name audit validation
  - Asserts migration idempotency
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All tests pass with `npm run test:schema`

### 4. Firestore Rules Updates
- **Analysis**: No legacy field names (`reviewerId`) found in `firestore.rules`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - No updates needed

### 5. Zod Schema Updates
- **Analysis**: No review-related Zod schemas found that use legacy field names
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - No updates needed

### 6. Legacy Field Name Removal
- **Verification**: `grep -R reviewerId src | wc -l == 0` (excluding test files)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - No legacy field names in source code

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Migration Configuration
```typescript
const FIELD_MIGRATIONS: FieldMigration[] = [
  {
    collection: 'reviews',
    oldField: 'reviewerId',
    newField: 'reviewerUid',
    description: 'Migrate reviewerId to reviewerUid for consistency with Uid naming convention'
  }
];
```

### Updated API Route
- **File**: `src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`
- **Change**: `reviewerId: req.user.uid` → `reviewerUid: req.user.uid`

### Backup Strategy
- Backups created in `/backups/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` directory
- Each collection backed up to individual JSON files
- Includes document ID, data, collection name, and timestamp

### Scripts Added to package.json
```json
{
  "migrate:fields": "ts-node scripts/migrateFields.ts",
  "audit:fields": "./scripts/audit-field-names.sh",
  "test:schema": "jest --testNamePattern=\"migrateFields\" --runInBand --ci"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Schema Test Results
```
✓ should have valid migration script
✓ should have migration from reviewerId to reviewerUid
✓ should have backup functionality
✓ should handle idempotency
✓ should exit with proper status codes
✓ should use reviewerUid instead of reviewerId
✓ should pass the field name audit
```

### Field Name Audit Results
```
🔍 Firestore Field Name Audit
==============================
📂 Scanning directories: src/ lib/ functions/ scripts/
🔍 Looking for patterns: reviewerId

🔍 Scanning for: reviewerId
✅ No occurrences of reviewerId found

📊 AUDIT SUMMARY
================
Total legacy field occurrences: 0
✅ AUDIT PASSED: No legacy field names found
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Running the Migration
```bash
npm run migrate:fields
```

### Running the Audit
```bash
npm run audit:fields
```

### Running Schema Tests
```bash
npm run test:schema
```

## 📋 Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `scripts/migrateFields.ts` - Main migration script
- `scripts/audit-field-names.sh` - Field name audit script
- `src/lib/firestore/__tests__/migrateFields.test.ts` - Schema validation tests

### Modified Files
- `src/app/api/reviews/route.ts` - Updated to use `reviewerUid`
- `package.json` - Added migration and testing scripts

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Idempotent Migration**: Safe to run multiple times
2. **Comprehensive Backup**: Full document backup before migration
3. **Detailed Logging**: Progress tracking and error reporting
4. **Schema Validation**: Automated tests ensure migration correctness
5. **Audit Compliance**: Verification that no legacy field names remain

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Migration script logs summary & exits 0
- ✅ Schema test passes (`npm run test:schema`)
- ✅ No legacy field names remain in code (`grep -R reviewerId src | wc -l == 0`)
- ✅ Migration is idempotent and handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Backup functionality preserves data integrity

## 📚 Additional Notes

- The migration system is designed to be extensible for future field name changes
- All tests use mocked Firebase to avoid requiring actual Firestore connection
- The audit script excludes test files and migration scripts themselves to avoid false positives
- Error handling ensures individual document failures don't stop the entire migration process
