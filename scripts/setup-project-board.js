## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the "Beta Launch" project board
as required by issue #273.

## Project Configuration
- **Title:** ${PROJECT_CONFIG.title}
- **Description:** ${PROJECT_CONFIG.description}
- **Repository:** auditoryx/X-Open-Netowrk

## Required Columns
The project board must have the following columns in order:

${PROJECT_CONFIG.columns.map((col, index) => `${index + 1}. **${col}**`).join('\n')}

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Project Board
Run the following command to create the project:

\`\`\`bash
gh project create --title "${PROJECT_CONFIG.title}" --body "${PROJECT_CONFIG.description}"
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Set Up Columns
Since GitHub CLI has limited project column management, you'll need to:

1. Go to [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/auditoryx/X-Open-Netowrk/projects)
2. Find the "${PROJECT_CONFIG.title}" project
3. Add columns manually using the web interface

### Step 3: Configure Column Automation (Recommended)
Set up the following automation rules:

- **Backlog:** Auto-add newly created issues with labels \`beta-gap\` or \`post-mvp\`
- **Ready:** Issues that are ready for development (manual move)
- **In Progress:** Auto-move when assigned to a developer
- **Review:** Auto-move when PR is created
- **Testing:** Auto-move when PR is merged
- **Done:** Auto-move when issue is closed

### Step 4: Add Issues to Project
Use the generated script to add all created issues to the backlog:

\`\`\`bash
./scripts/add-issues-to-project.sh
\`\`\`

## Project Board Views
Consider setting up these views for better organization:

### By Priority
- Filter by priority labels (\`priority:critical\`, \`priority:high\`, etc.)
- Sort by priority level

### By Milestone
- Group by milestone (\`Pre Launch Sprint\`, \`Beta v1.1\`, etc.)
- Sort by due date

### By Assignee
- Group by assigned team member
- Shows workload distribution

### By Label
- Filter by feature area (\`authentication\`, \`payments\`, \`ui-ux\`, etc.)
- Helps track progress by domain

## Maintenance
- Review project board weekly
- Update issue status as work progresses
- Archive completed issues monthly
- Update automation rules as needed

## Success Metrics
- All ${PROJECT_CONFIG.columns.length} columns configured
- All issues added to backlog
- Automation rules active
- Team members have access
- Regular updates being made

## Troubleshooting

### Project Not Found
If the project doesn't appear, check:
- Project was created successfully
- You have proper repository permissions
- Project is public/visible to team

### Issues Not Adding
If issues won't add to project:
- Verify project ID is correct
- Check issue exists and is accessible
- Ensure proper GitHub CLI authentication

### Automation Not Working
If column automation fails:
- Review automation rule configuration
- Check rule triggers and conditions
- Test with a sample issue

## Next Steps After Setup
1. Comment "DONE" on issue #273 with project board summary
2. Share project board link with team
3. Begin triaging and assigning issues
4. Set up regular project review meetings
