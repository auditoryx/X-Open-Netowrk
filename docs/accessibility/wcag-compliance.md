## Implementation Details

### Accessibility Components

We have developed a comprehensive set of accessible components:

```typescript
import { AccessibleButton } from '@/components/ui/accessible/AccessibleButton';

<AccessibleButton
  variant="primary"
  aria-label="Save document"
  announcement="Document saved successfully"
  onClick={handleSave}
>
  Save
</AccessibleButton>
```

#### AccessibleForm Components
```typescript
import { AccessibleInput, AccessibleLabel } from '@/components/ui/accessible/AccessibleForm';

<AccessibleInput
  label="Email Address"
  type="email"
  required
  error={errors.email}
  description="We'll never share your email"
/>
```

#### FocusManager
```typescript
import { ModalFocusManager } from '@/components/ui/accessible/FocusManager';

<ModalFocusManager isOpen={isModalOpen} onClose={closeModal}>
  <div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="modal-title">
    {/* Modal content */}
  </div>
</ModalFocusManager>
```

### Keyboard Navigation Patterns

#### Arrow Key Navigation
- List items: Up/Down arrows
- Grid items: Arrow keys in all directions
- Tab panels: Left/Right arrows
- Menu items: Up/Down arrows

#### Common Shortcuts

#### Automated Testing
We use Playwright for automated accessibility testing:
```bash
npm run test:accessibility
```
