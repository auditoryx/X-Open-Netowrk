## üìä Issue Creation Automation Script

Here's a template for automating issue creation:

```javascript
// Example GitHub CLI script for bulk issue creation
const issues = [
  {
    title: "[CRITICAL] Implement Complete Password Reset Flow",
    labels: ["beta-gap", "authentication", "security", "priority:critical"],
    milestone: "Beta Launch",
    body: "Password reset functionality is completely missing...",
    assignees: ["auditoryx"]
  },
  // ... more issues
];

// GitHub CLI commands
issues.forEach(issue => {
  const command = `gh issue create \\
    --title "${issue.title}" \\
    --body "${issue.body}" \\
    --label "${issue.labels.join(',')}" \\
    --milestone "${issue.milestone}" \\
    --assignee "${issue.assignees.join(',')}"`;
  
  console.log(command);
