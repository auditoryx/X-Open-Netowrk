# Beta Launch Project Board Setup Guide

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the "Beta Launch" project board
as required by issue #273.

## Project Configuration
- **Title:** Beta Launch
- **Description:** Beta launch issue tracking and project management board
- **Repository:** auditoryx/X-Open-Netowrk

## Required Columns
The project board must have the following columns in order:

1. **Backlog**
2. **Ready**
3. **In Progress**
4. **Review**
5. **Testing**
6. **Done**

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Project Board
Run the following command to create the project:

```bash
gh project create --title "Beta Launch" --body "Beta launch issue tracking and project management board"
```

### Step 2: Set Up Columns
Since GitHub CLI has limited project column management, you'll need to:

1. Go to [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/auditoryx/X-Open-Netowrk/projects)
2. Find the "Beta Launch" project
3. Add columns manually using the web interface

### Step 3: Configure Column Automation (Recommended)
Set up the following automation rules:

- **Backlog:** Auto-add newly created issues with labels `beta-gap` or `post-mvp`
- **Ready:** Issues that are ready for development (manual move)
- **In Progress:** Auto-move when assigned to a developer
- **Review:** Auto-move when PR is created
- **Testing:** Auto-move when PR is merged
- **Done:** Auto-move when issue is closed

### Step 4: Add Issues to Project
Use the generated script to add all created issues to the backlog:

```bash
./scripts/add-issues-to-project.sh
```

## Project Board Views
Consider setting up these views for better organization:

### By Priority
- Filter by priority labels (`priority:critical`, `priority:high`, etc.)
- Sort by priority level

### By Milestone
- Group by milestone (`Pre Launch Sprint`, `Beta v1.1`, etc.)
- Sort by due date

### By Assignee
- Group by assigned team member
- Shows workload distribution

### By Label
- Filter by feature area (`authentication`, `payments`, `ui-ux`, etc.)
- Helps track progress by domain

## Maintenance
- Review project board weekly
- Update issue status as work progresses
- Archive completed issues monthly
- Update automation rules as needed

## Success Metrics
- All 6 columns configured
- All issues added to backlog
- Automation rules active
- Team members have access
- Regular updates being made

## Troubleshooting

### Project Not Found
If the project doesn't appear, check:
- Project was created successfully
- You have proper repository permissions
- Project is public/visible to team

### Issues Not Adding
If issues won't add to project:
- Verify project ID is correct
- Check issue exists and is accessible
- Ensure proper GitHub CLI authentication

### Automation Not Working
If column automation fails:
- Review automation rule configuration
- Check rule triggers and conditions
- Test with a sample issue

## Next Steps After Setup
1. Comment "DONE" on issue #273 with project board summary
2. Share project board link with team
3. Begin triaging and assigning issues
4. Set up regular project review meetings
