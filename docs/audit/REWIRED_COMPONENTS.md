- **Preserved for Future Use**: 3

## Key Findings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Audit Report False Positives Detected
During Phase 2 review, several components marked as "unused" in the audit were found to be actively used:

1. **CollabBookingSummary** - Used in dashboard collab booking details
2. **SmartSearchResults** - Used in main search interface  
3. **AdvancedSearchInterface** - Used in main search interface

This suggests the static analysis may have missed dynamic imports or had path resolution issues.

## Review Process

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Potential Value**: Does the component solve a real business need?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the implementation solid and maintainable?  
3. **Integration Effort**: How much work is needed to wire it up?
4. **Duplication Risk**: Does similar functionality already exist?

### Priority Targets for Review
- Admin components: `AdminVerificationRequests.tsx`, `AssignRoleForm.tsx` 
- Dashboard variants: `ArtistDashboard.tsx`, `EngineerDashboard.tsx`
- Form utilities: `add*`, `remove*`, `handle*` functions
- Booking/collab features: `CollabBookingSummary.tsx`
- Search enhancements: `AdvancedSearchInterface.tsx`
